# HandwritingRecognition
This repository contains the code and documentation for a handwriting recognition system, created as part of a project to familiarize myself with computer vision techniques

## Overview

### Problem Statement

In the digital age, converting handwritten documents into machine-readable text remains a significant challenge, particularly for automating tasks in education, healthcare, and data entry. Handwriting varies greatly between individuals, and this variability poses difficulties for accurate recognition by traditional methods. The goal of this project is to develop a system that efficiently converts images of handwritten text into digital text using computer vision techniques, enabling faster and more accurate data processing across different handwriting styles.
